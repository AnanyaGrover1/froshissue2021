    <h1>Advice for Frosh</h1>
    <h4 id="subtitle-editor">By Daily Princetonian Staff</h4>
    
  
    <p> "Take college as your chance to do new things — yes, including that hobby or that outfit you’ve always wanted to try but never had the courage or time to do!"
    <br>- Claire Shin ‘25
    </p>

    <p> "Princeton is a great place to spend your next 4 years at, so make the most of it - you get to decide who and what will be a part of that experience! Never lose sight of your values and always ask for support."
    <br>- Audrey Chau ‘25
    </p> 

    <p> "Explore a lot! There are so many wonderful people, events, clubs, and classes at Princeton, so actively seek out experiences that bring you joy. At the same time, be mindful to take care of yourself as well—staying healthy is super important and helps you enjoy everything more :)"
    <br>- Audrey Zhang '25
    </p>

    <p> "You're gonna want to try a lot of things. That's good, but remember that it's okay to back out of something if it gets to be too much. Just be upfront about it and tell the relevant person that you can no longer fully commit. Ultimately, always do what's best for YOU, and keep in mind that duck syndrome is real."
    <br>- Elizabeth Medina '24
    </p> 
    
    <p>"Try the pistachio matcha at Coffee Club."
    <br>- Sophia Colmenares '24
    </p>

    <p> "Take the time to find what you love doing, both inside and outside the classroom. It's okay to change your mind, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Seek them."
    <br>- Anika Buch '24
    </p> 
    
    <p>"Do things because they excite you, not to pack a resume. Do less so that you can enjoy more free time. Care for each other."
    <br>- José Pablo Fernández García '23
    </p>

    <p> "College isn’t easy, but know that you aren’t alone in going through the hard parts and there are so many people who are there to help you get past it."
    <br>- Katherine Dailey ’24
    </p> 
    
    <p>"Just have fun with it!"
    <br>- Jojo '23
    </p>

    <p> "Sometimes it is better to do mediocrely or even badly on an assignment rather than miss doing something joy-bringing with your friends."
    <br>- Hope Perry '24
    </p> 
    
    <p> "Join the Prince!!! It's super fun!!"
    <br>- Sidney Singer '25
    </p>

    <p> "1.) Talk to your professors. Not only will they appreciate your effort, but this is the best way to make the most of your Princeton education. 
        2.) Always keep a notebook on hand. Write down interesting things your peers and professors say. Write down questions that spark your intellectual curiosity. Write down experiences you want to remember. Your future self will thank you. 
        3.) Have a plan for what class, major, and activities path you want to choose, but be open to that plan changing. Be prepared for it to change. 
        4.) Understand the importance of good sleep. It can be tempting to get swept up in the excitement of new social and academic opportunities but realize your college life will be more enjoyable with rest."
    <br>- Kalena Blake '24
    </p> 
    
    <p> "Try everything! Sign up for all the clubs that even remotely pique your interest, and then see what sticks. Princeton has a reputation for having incredibly selective clubs, but I recommend applying/auditioning for everything. People are excited to meet you, and you’ll likely have more success than you anticipate. Good luck!"
    <br>- Anika Asthana '25
    </p>

    <p> "College is very busy; it is normal to feel challenged to balance everything out. Remember: taking the time to rest and hang out with friends now and then is as crucial as studying! Also, ask for advice/help and listen to others who you deem wise to learn and be better (at whatever it is you are trying to improve)!"
    <br>- Liz Garcia '25
    </p>

    <p> "Surround yourself with people you feel comfortable, unfiltered, and appreciated with. These may not be the your first friends, or the friends of your friends. Be intentional."
    <br>- Ian Fridman ‘25
    </p> 
    
    <p>"Change up your study spots often. Late meal saves lives."
    <br>- Michelle Liu '25
    </p>

    <p> "Princeton is very, very lucky to have you.  Don't forget it, and never lose the courage to try hard things."
    <br>- Rohit Narayanan '24
    </p> 
    
    <p>"In the words of the 145th Editorial Board, "ask for the damn extension."
    <br> - Caitlin Limestahl '23
